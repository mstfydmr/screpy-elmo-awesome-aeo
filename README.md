# Awesome Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Official documentation, crawler user agents, specifications, research, and tools for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) in 2026.

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) are the practice of making web content discoverable, retrievable, and citable by answer engines such as ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews and AI Mode, Perplexity, Google Gemini, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and Grok. The two terms are used interchangeably by most practitioners. Where a distinction is drawn, Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) emphasizes being cited in a direct answer, and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) emphasizes influencing the generated text itself.

### Grok and xAI

xAI publishes no crawler documentation. There is no vendor page listing Grok's user agents, no robots.txt guidance, and no published IP ranges, so this list has no entry to give you. Third-party crawler directories publish conflicting strings for xAI; because none of them is the operator, none is cited here. If xAI publishes documentation, [open an issue](https://github.com/elmohq/awesome-answer-engine-optimization/issues) and it will be added.

- [xAI Documentation](https://docs.x.ai/overview) - xAI's developer documentation, listed so you can confirm for yourself that it covers the API and not crawling or publisher controls.

### Other Crawler Operators

Not answer engines in their own right, but they crawl for AI systems and show up in the same access logs.

- [About Applebot](https://support.apple.com/en-us/119829) - Applebot user-agent formats plus Applebot-Extended, Apple's robots.txt opt-out for generative model training.
- [Amazonbot](https://developer.amazon.com/amazonbot) - Amazonbot's user-agent string and Amazon's statement that crawled data may train Amazon AI models.
- [Mistral Crawlers](https://docs.mistral.ai/robots) - One of the few vendors that separates training, indexing, and user-triggered fetching into three distinct user agents.
- [DuckAssistBot](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/duckassistbot) - DuckDuckGo's real-time fetcher for AI-assisted answers, with an explicit statement that it does not train models.
- [Meta Web Crawlers](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/sharing/webmasters/web-crawlers) - Meta's list of crawler user agents, separating the training and indexing crawler from the user-request fetcher.
- [CCBot](https://commoncrawl.org/ccbot) - The Common Crawl crawler, whose archives are an input to many model training pipelines.

## Crawler User Agents

Every string below is quoted from the operator's own documentation linked in the section above. Where a vendor publishes only a robots.txt token and not a full user-agent string, that is stated rather than filled in from a third-party directory. Version numbers change without notice, so match on the token, never on the whole string.

The distinction that matters for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the one between crawlers that build a corpus and fetchers that act for a user in real time. Blocking the first affects whether a model knows about you at all. Blocking the second affects whether you can be cited in an answer being generated right now. Several vendors state that user-triggered fetchers do not follow robots.txt.

### Training Crawlers

Collect content that may be used to train foundation models.

| Operator     | robots.txt token     | Full user-agent string as documented                                                                                      |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI       | `GPTBot`             | `Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko); compatible; GPTBot/1.4; +https://openai.com/gptbot`                  |
| Anthropic    | `ClaudeBot`          | Not published                                                                                                             |

| Meta         | `meta-externalagent` | `meta-externalagent/1.1 (+/documentation/sharing/webmasters/web-crawlers)`                                                |
| Common Crawl | `CCBot`              | `CCBot/2.0`                                                                                                               |

### Search Index Crawlers

Build the retrieval index an answer engine draws on. These are the crawlers that determine whether you are eligible to be cited at all.

| Operator   | robots.txt token   | Full user-agent string as documented                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI     | `OAI-SearchBot`    | `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36; compatible; OAI-SearchBot/1.4; +https://openai.com/searchbot` |
| Perplexity | `PerplexityBot`    | `Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; PerplexityBot/1.0; +https://perplexity.ai/perplexitybot)`                                                             |
| Anthropic  | `Claude-SearchBot` | Not published                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Google     | `Googlebot`        | `Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html) Chrome/W.X.Y.Z Safari/537.36`                                         |
| Microsoft  | `bingbot`          | `Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; bingbot/2.0; +http://www.bing.com/bingbot.htm) Chrome/W.X.Y.Z Safari/537.36 Edg/W.X.Y.Z`                              |
| Mistral    | `MistralAI-Index`  | `Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; MistralAI-Index/1.0; +https://docs.mistral.ai/robots)`                                                                |

Google's position is that "AI is built into Search and integral to how Search functions, which is why robots.txt directives for Googlebot is the control for site owners to manage access to how their sites are crawled for Search." There is no separate AI Overviews or AI Mode crawler to allow or block. Perplexity states that PerplexityBot is used to surface and link sites in Perplexity search results and is not used to crawl content for AI foundation models.

### User-Triggered Fetchers

Fetch a page in real time because a user asked a question right now. Several operators document that these fetchers do not honor robots.txt, because the request originates from a person rather than from an automated crawl.

| Operator   | robots.txt token       | Full user-agent string as documented                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenAI     | `ChatGPT-User`         | `Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko); compatible; ChatGPT-User/1.0; +https://openai.com/bot`                   |
| Perplexity | `Perplexity-User`      | `Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; Perplexity-User/1.0; +https://perplexity.ai/perplexity-user)` |
| Anthropic  | `Claude-User`          | Not published                                                                                                                 |
| Mistral    | `MistralAI-User`       | `Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; MistralAI-User/1.0; +https://docs.mistral.ai/robots)`         |
| DuckDuckGo | `DuckAssistBot`        | `DuckAssistBot/1.2; (+http://duckduckgo.com/duckassistbot.html)`                                                              |
| Meta       | `meta-externalfetcher` | `meta-externalfetcher/1.1 (+/documentation/sharing/webmasters/web-crawlers)`                                                  |

Perplexity documents that Perplexity-User generally ignores robots.txt rules because the fetch is user-initiated. Meta documents that meta-externalfetcher may bypass robots.txt for the same reason.

### Control Tokens Without a Crawler

These appear in robots.txt but never in an access log. They are opt-out switches, not user agents, and blocking them has no effect on search crawling.

| Token               | Operator | What disallowing it does, per the vendor                                                                                                                                          |

| `Google-Extended`   | Google   | Excludes the site from helping improve Gemini Apps and Vertex AI generative APIs. Google documents it as a standalone product token that uses existing Google user-agent strings. |
| `Applebot-Extended` | Apple    | Excludes the site's content from training Apple foundation models, without affecting Applebot's search crawling.                                                                  |

Google-Extended does not control AI Overviews or AI Mode. Google's AI features documentation points to `nosnippet`, `data-nosnippet`, `max-snippet`, and `noindex` for those, and Search Console carries a separate opt-out for generative AI features in Search.

### Verifying a Crawler Is Genuine

User-agent strings are trivially spoofed, so treat the string as a claim and verify it.

- [Verify Google Crawler Requests](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/crawlers-fetchers/verify-google-requests) - Reverse-DNS and IP-range verification for Google's crawlers and fetchers.
- [How to Verify Bingbot](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/how-to-verify-bingbot-3905dc26) - Reverse-DNS verification for Microsoft's crawler.

OpenAI and Perplexity both take the IP-range approach instead: each publishes a JSON file of the prefixes its bots crawl from, linked in their sections above. Match the requesting address against that file rather than trusting the user-agent header.

## Specifications and Standards

### Robots and Publisher Controls

- [RFC 9309: Robots Exclusion Protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9309) - The robots.txt standard itself, which every AI crawler control is layered on top of.
- [How Google Interprets the robots.txt Specification](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/robots-txt/robots-txt-spec) - The most detailed public description of real-world robots.txt parsing, including token matching and precedence.
- [Robots Meta Tags Specifications](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag) - The snippet-level controls that determine how much of a page an answer engine may quote.
- [IETF AI Preferences Working Group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/aipref/about/) - The standards effort to replace today's incompatible per-vendor tokens with one vocabulary.
- [A Vocabulary for Expressing AI Usage Preferences](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-aipref-vocab/) - The draft vocabulary of preference terms.
- [Attaching AI Preferences to Content](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-aipref-attach/) - The companion draft for expressing those preferences in robots.txt and HTTP headers.
- [ai.robots.txt](https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt) - Community-maintained robots.txt blocklist of known AI crawler tokens, updated as vendors add agents.

### llms.txt

- [The llms.txt Proposal](https://llmstxt.org/) - Jeremy Howard's proposal for a Markdown file that gives models a curated map of a site. It is a community convention, not a standard, and no engine documented in this list commits to reading it.
- [llms-txt Repository](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/llms-txt) - The reference implementation and specification source.
- [llms.txt Directory](https://directory.llmstxt.cloud/) - Directory of sites that publish an llms.txt file.
- [llms.txt Site Index](https://llmstxt.site/) - A second index of published llms.txt files, useful for seeing real-world formatting in practice.

Weigh the effort against what the engines say. Google's optimization guide addresses llms.txt by name and states that you do not need to create new machine-readable files, AI text files, markup, or Markdown to appear in Google Search including its generative AI capabilities, "as Google Search itself doesn't use them." No other engine in this list documents reading llms.txt either. That does not make publishing one harmful; it does mean nobody has documented a benefit.

### Structured Data for Extraction

Google's guidance is explicit that no special structured data is required for AI features. Structured data still earns rich results in classic search, still disambiguates entities, and is still the cheapest way to state facts unambiguously, which is why these types stay on the list.

- [Introduction to Structured Data Markup](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data) - How search systems consume schema.org markup and which formats are accepted.
- [schema.org/Organization](https://schema.org/Organization) - Entity identity: names, logos, `sameAs` links, and the disambiguation an engine needs to know who you are.
- [schema.org/Article](https://schema.org/Article) - Authorship, publication date, and publisher, the provenance fields that citation-bearing answers lean on.
- [schema.org/FAQPage](https://schema.org/FAQPage) - Explicit question-and-answer pairs, the structure that most closely matches how an answer engine chunks a page.
- [schema.org/QAPage](https://schema.org/QAPage) - A single user-submitted question with answers, distinct from `FAQPage`.
- [schema.org/HowTo](https://schema.org/HowTo) - Ordered steps with tools and materials, for procedural answers.
- [schema.org/Product](https://schema.org/Product) - Product identity, offers, and reviews, the fields commercial answers are assembled from.
- [schema.org/Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset) - Dataset descriptions, licensing, and distribution.
- [schema.org/BreadcrumbList](https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList) - Page position within a site, which supplies hierarchy an extractor would otherwise have to infer.

### Measurement Standards

- [IAB: Measuring Visibility in the AI Era](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/measuring-visibility-in-the-ai-era/) - The industry framework for measuring brand and publisher visibility in AI-powered discovery, published August 2026. It defines a common metrics hierarchy called the four P's, distinguishes decision-grade from directional measurement, and sets disclosure requirements for vendors. It is the closest thing this field has to an agreed vocabulary.

## Analytics and Measurement

Where each engine's activity actually shows up. Two different things get measured and they are easy to confuse: whether you were *cited* inside an answer, and whether a person *clicked through* to your site. Vendor consoles report the first. Your own analytics report the second, and only for the fraction of answers that produce a click at all.

### Vendor-Reported Visibility

- [Generative AI Performance Report for Search](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/16984139) - Search Console impressions for AI Overviews and AI Mode, broken down by page, country, device, and date.
- [Generative AI Performance Report for Discover](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/16983858) - The equivalent report for generative AI features in Google Discover.
- [Introducing Search Generative AI Performance Reports](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2026/06/gen-ai-performance-reports) - Google's announcement of those reports and what the metrics do and do not include.
- [Bing Webmaster Tools AI Performance](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/ai-performance-9f8e7d6c) - Citation counts, page-level performance, and the grounding queries Copilot generated internally to find your content.

Google reports impressions in generative AI features. Microsoft reports citations and grounding queries, and since June 2026 also intent labels, topic groups, and citation share; both Microsoft announcements are linked in the Copilot section above. Impressions and citations are not the same metric and should not be summed.

Neither Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, nor xAI operates a public webmaster console reporting citations back to site owners. For those engines, referral traffic and third-party trackers are all there is.

### Referral Traffic Attribution

- [GA4 Default Channel Group](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9756891) - Google Analytics documents an `AI Assistants` channel for arrivals from sources like ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Grok, assigned when the medium is `ai-assistant` or the referrer matches Google's list of AI assistants. Google notes this channel excludes AI Overviews and AI Mode, which are reported as ordinary organic search.
- [Custom Channel Groups](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/13051316) - How to build your own grouping if you need engines split individually rather than pooled.

Referral analytics only ever sees the answers that produced a click. To see the fetches that produced none, you need the server-side view from an edge tool such as Cloudflare AI Crawl Control, listed under Tools above.

Clicks from an answer engine arrive as ordinary referral traffic with that engine's hostname as the referrer. No vendor in this list publishes a specification of its referrer strings, so any fixed list of them is an observation rather than documentation, and this list does not publish one. Read the referrer hostnames out of your own logs and confirm them against your own traffic before hard-coding them into a report.
